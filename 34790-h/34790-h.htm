 <div class="stanza">
  <span class="i1">Do you recall those bygone days,</span>
  <span class="i0">When you received with kindly praise</span>
  <span class="i2">My bantling book of Rhyme?</span>
  <span class="i0">Praise undeserved, alas! and yet</span>
  <span class="i0">How sweet! For, tho' we had not met,</span>
  <span class="i2">(Ah! what a waste of time!)</span>
  <span class="i0">I could the more enjoy such mercies</span>
  <span class="i0">Since I delighted in <i>your</i> verses.</span>
 </div>

 <div class="stanza">
  <span class="i0">And when a Poet stoops to smile</span>
  <span class="i0">On some one of the rank and file,</span>
  <span class="i2">(Inglorious&mdash;if not mute,)</span>
  <span class="i0">Some groundling bard who craves to climb,</span>
  <span class="i0">Like me, the dizzy rungs of Rhyme,</span>
  <span class="i2">To reach the Golden Fruit;</span>
  <span class="i0">For one in such a situation</span>
  <span class="i0">The faintest praise is no damnation.</span>
 </div>

 <div class="stanza">
  <span class="i0">Parnassus heights must surely pall;</span>
  <span class="i0">For simpler diet do you call,</span>
  <span class="i2">Of nectar growing tired?</span>
  <span class="i0">These verses to your feet I bring,</span>
  <span class="i0">Drawn from an unassuming spring,</span>
  <span class="i2">Well-meant&mdash;if not inspired;</span>
  <span class="i0">O charming Poet's charming daughter,</span>
  <span class="i0">Descend and taste my toast and water!</span>
 </div>

 <div class="stanza">
  <span class="i0">For you alone these lines I write,</span>
  <span class="i0">That, reading them, your brow may light</span>
  <span class="i2">Beneath its crown of bays;</span>
  <span class="i0">Your eyes may sparkle like a star,</span>
  <span class="i0">With friendship, that is dearer far</span>
  <span class="i2">Than any breath of praise;</span>
  <span class="i0">The which a lucky man possessing</span>
  <span class="i0">Can ask no higher human blessing.</span>
 </div>

 <div class="stanza">
  <span class="i0">And, though the "salt estranging sea"</span>
  <span class="i0">Be widely spread 'twixt you and me,</span>
  <span class="i2">We have what makes amends;</span>
  <span class="i0">And since I am so glad of you,</span>
  <span class="i0">Be glad of me a little, too,</span>
  <span class="i2">Because of being friends.</span>
  <span class="i0">And, if I earn your approbation,</span>
  <span class="i0">Accept my humble dedication.</span>

<div class="poem">
 <div class="stanza">
  <span class="i1">The Press may pass my Verses by</span>
  <span class="i2">With sentiments of indignation,</span>
  <span class="i0">And say, like Greeks of old, that I</span>
  <span class="i2">Corrupt the Youthful Generation;</span>
  <span class="i0">I am unmoved by taunts like these&mdash;</span>
  <span class="i0">(And so, I think, was Socrates).</span>
 </div>

 <div class="stanza">
  <span class="i0">Howe'er the Critics may revile,</span>
  <span class="i2">I pick no journalistic quarrels,</span>
  <span class="i0">Quite realizing that my Style</span>
  <span class="i2">Makes up for any lack of Morals;</span>
  <span class="i0">For which I feel no shred of shame&mdash;</span>
  <span class="i0">(And Byron would have felt the same).</span>
 </div>

 <div class="stanza">
  <span class="i0">I don't intend a Child to read</span>
  <span class="i2">These lines, which are not for the Young;</span>
  <span class="i0">For, if I did, I should indeed</span>
  <span class="i2">Feel fully worthy to be hung.</span>
  <span class="i0">(Is "hanged" the perfect tense of "hang"?</span>
  <span class="i0">Correct me, Mr. Andrew Lang!)</span>
 </div>

 <div class="stanza">
  <span class="i0">O Young of Heart, tho' in your prime,</span>
  <span class="i2">By you these Verses may be seen!</span>
  <span class="i0">Accept the Moral with the Rhyme,</span>
  <span class="i2">And try to gather what I mean.</span>
  <span class="i0">But, if you can't, it won't hurt me!</span>
  <span class="i0">(And Browning would, I know, agree.)</span>
 </div>

 <div class="stanza">
  <span class="i0">Be reassured, I have not got</span>
  <span class="i2">The style of Stephen Phillips' heroes,</span>
  <span class="i0">Nor Henry Jones's pow'r of Plot,</span>
  <span class="i2">Nor wit like Arthur Wing Pinero's!</span>
  <span class="i0">(If so, I should not waste my time</span>
  <span class="i0">In writing you this sort of rhyme.)</span>
 </div>

 <div class="stanza">
  <span class="i0">I strive to paint things as they Are,</span>
  <span class="i2">Of Realism the true Apostle;</span>
  <span class="i0">All flow'ry metaphors I bar,</span>
  <span class="i2">Nor call the homely thrush a "throstle."</span>
  <span class="i0">Such synonyms would make me smile.</span>
  <span class="i0">(And so they would have made Carlyle.)</span>
 </div>

 <div class="stanza">
  <span class="i0">My Style may be at times, I own,</span>
  <span class="i2">A trifle cryptic or abstruse;</span>
  <span class="i0">In this I do not stand alone,</span>
  <span class="i2">And need but mention, in excuse,</span>
  <span class="i0">A thousand world-familiar names,</span>
  <span class="i0">From Meredith to Henry James.</span>
 </div>

 <div class="stanza">
  <span class="i0">From these my fruitless fancy roams</span>
  <span class="i2">To seek the Ade of Modern Fable,</span>
  <span class="i0">From Doyle's or Hemans' "Stately Ho(l)mes,"</span>
  <span class="i2">To t'other of The Breakfast Table;</span>
  <span class="i0">Like Galahad, I wish (in vain)</span>
  <span class="i0">"My wit were as the wit of Twain!"</span>
 </div>

 <div class="stanza">
  <span class="i0">Had I but Whitman's rugged skill,</span>
  <span class="i2">(And managed to escape the Censor),</span>
  <span class="i0">The Accuracy of a Mill,</span>
  <span class="i2">The Reason of a Herbert Spencer,</span>
  <span class="i0">The literary talents even</span>
  <span class="i0">Of Sidney Lee or Leslie Stephen.</span>
 </div>

 <div class="stanza">
  <span class="i0">The pow'r of Patmore's placid pen,</span>
  <span class="i2">Or Watson's gift of execration,</span>
  <span class="i0">The sugar of Le Gallienne,</span>
  <span class="i2">Or Algernon's Alliteration.</span>
  <span class="i0">One post there is I'd not be lost in,</span>
  <span class="i0">&mdash;Tho' I might find it most ex-austin'!</span>
 </div>

 <div class="stanza">
  <span class="i0">Some day, if I but study hard,</span>
  <span class="i2">The public, vanquished by my pen'll</span>
  <span class="i0">Acclaim me as a Minor Bard,</span>
  <span class="i2">Like Norman Gale or Mrs. Meynell,</span>
  <span class="i0">And listen to my lyre a-rippling</span>
  <span class="i0">Imperial banjo-spasms like Kipling.</span>
 </div>

 <div class="stanza">
  <span class="i0">Were I a syndicate like K.</span>
  <span class="i2">Or flippant scholar like Augustine;</span>
  <span class="i0">Had I the style of Pater, say,</span>
  <span class="i2">Which ev'ryone would put their trust in,</span>
  <span class="i0">I'd love (as busy as a squirrel)</span>
  <span class="i0">To pate, to kipple, and to birrel.</span>
 </div>

 <div class="stanza">
  <span class="i0">So don't ignore me. If you should,</span>
  <span class="i2">'Twill touch me to the very heart oh!</span>
  <span class="i0">To be as much misunderstood</span>
  <span class="i2">As once was Andrea del Sarto;</span>
  <span class="i0">Unrecognized to toil away,</span>
  <span class="i0">Like Millet&mdash;not, of course, Mill<i>ais</i>.</span>
 </div>

 <div class="stanza">
  <span class="i0">And, pray, for Morals do not look</span>
  <span class="i2">In this unique agglomeration,</span>
  <span class="i0">&mdash;This unpretentious little book</span>
  <span class="i2">Of Infelicitous Quotation.</span>
  <span class="i0">I deem you foolish if you do,</span>
  <span class="i0">(And Mr. Russell thinks so, too).</span>
 </div>

<h3 class="p4"><i>"Virtue is Its Own Reward"</i></h3>

<div class="poem">
 <div class="stanza">
  <span class="i1">Virtue its own reward? Alas!</span>
  <span class="i2">And what a poor one as a rule!</span>
  <span class="i0">Be Virtuous and Life will pass</span>
  <span class="i2">Like one long term of Sunday-School.</span>
  <span class="i0">(No prospect, truly, could one find</span>
  <span class="i0">More unalluring to the mind.)</span>
 </div>

 <div class="stanza">
  <span class="i0">You may imagine that it pays</span>
  <span class="i2">To practise Goodness. Not a bit!</span>
  <span class="i0">You cease receiving any praise</span>
  <span class="i2">When people have got used to it;</span>
  <span class="i0">'Tis generally understood</span>
  <span class="i0">You find it <i>easy</i> to be good.</span>
 </div>

 <div class="stanza">
  <span class="i0">The Model Child has got to keep</span>
  <span class="i2">His fingers and his garments white;</span>
  <span class="i0">In church he may not go to sleep,</span>
  <span class="i2">Nor ask to stop up late at night.</span>
  <span class="i0">In fact he must not ever do</span>
  <span class="i0">A single thing he wishes to.</span>
 </div>

 <div class="stanza">
  <span class="i0">He may not paddle in his boots,</span>
  <span class="i2">Like naughty children, at the Sea;</span>
  <span class="i0">The sweetness of Forbidden Fruits</span>
  <span class="i2">Is not, alas! for such as he.</span>
  <span class="i0">He watches, with pathetic eyes,</span>
  <span class="i0">His weaker brethren make mud-pies.</span>
 </div>

 <div class="stanza">
  <span class="i0">He must not answer back, oh no!</span>
  <span class="i2">However rude grown-ups may be,</span>
  <span class="i0">But keep politely silent, tho'</span>
  <span class="i2">He brim with scathing repartee;</span>
  <span class="i0">For nothing is considered worse</span>
  <span class="i0">Than scoring off Mamma or Nurse.</span>
 </div>

 <div class="stanza">
  <span class="i0">He must not eat too much at meals,</span>
  <span class="i2">Nor scatter crumbs upon the floor;</span>
  <span class="i0">However vacuous he feels,</span>
  <span class="i2">He may not pass his plate for more;</span>
  <span class="i0">&mdash;Not tho' his ev'ry organ ache</span>
  <span class="i0">For further slabs of Christmas cake.</span>
 </div>

 <div class="stanza">
  <span class="i0">He is enjoined to choose his food</span>
  <span class="i2">From what is easy to digest;</span>
  <span class="i0">A choice which in itself is good,</span>
  <span class="i2">But never what <i>he</i> likes the best.</span>
  <span class="i0">(At times how madly he must wish</span>
  <span class="i0">For just <i>one</i> real unwholesome dish!)</span>
 </div>

 <div class="stanza">
  <span class="i0">And, when the wretched urchin plays</span>
  <span class="i2">With other little girls and boys,</span>
  <span class="i0">He has to show unselfish ways</span>
  <span class="i2">By giving them his choicest toys;</span>
  <span class="i0">His ears he lets them freely box,</span>
  <span class="i0">Or pull his lubricated locks.</span>
 </div>

 <div class="stanza">
  <span class="i0">His face is always being washed,</span>
  <span class="i2">His hair perpetually brushed,</span>
  <span class="i0">And thus his brighter side is squashed,</span>
  <span class="i2">His human instincts warped and crushed;</span>
  <span class="i0">Small wonder that his early years</span>
  <span class="i0">Are filled with "thoughts too deep for tears."</span>
 </div>

 <div class="stanza">
  <span class="i0">He is commanded not to waste</span>
  <span class="i2">The fleeting hours of childhood's days</span>
  <span class="i0">By giving way to any taste</span>
  <span class="i2">For circuses or matinées;</span>
  <span class="i0">For him the entertainments planned</span>
  <span class="i0">Are "Lectures on the Holy Land."</span>
 </div>

 <div class="stanza">
  <span class="i0">He never reads a story book</span>
  <span class="i2">By Rider H. or Winston C.,</span>
  <span class="i0">In vain upon his desk you'd look</span>
  <span class="i2">For tales by Richard Harding D.;</span>
  <span class="i0">Nor could you find upon his shelf</span>
  <span class="i0">The works of Rudyard&mdash;or myself!</span>
 </div>

 <div class="stanza">
  <span class="i0">He always fears that he may do</span>
  <span class="i2">Some action that is <i>infra dig.</i>,</span>
  <span class="i0">And so he lives his short life through</span>
  <span class="i2">In the most noxious rôle of Prig.</span>
  <span class="i0">("Short life" I say, for it's agreed</span>
  <span class="i0">The Good die very young indeed.)</span>
 </div>

 <div class="stanza">
  <span class="i0">Ah me! How sad it is to think</span>
  <span class="i2">He could have lived like me&mdash;or you!</span>
  <span class="i0">With practice and a taste for drink,</span>
  <span class="i2">Our joys he might have known, he too!</span>
  <span class="i0">And shared the pleasure <i>we</i> have had</span>
  <span class="i0">In being gloriously bad!</span>
 </div>

 <div class="stanza">
  <span class="i0">The Naughty Boy gets much delight</span>
  <span class="i2">From doing what he should not do;</span>
  <span class="i0">But, as such conduct isn't Right,</span>
  <span class="i2">He sometimes suffers for it, too.</span>
  <span class="i0">Yet, what's a spanking to the fun</span>
  <span class="i0">Of leaving vital things Undone?</span>
 </div>

 <div class="stanza">
  <span class="i0">If he's notoriously bad,</span>
  <span class="i2">But for a day should change his ways,</span>
  <span class="i0">His parents will be all so glad,</span>
  <span class="i2">They'll shower him with gifts and praise!</span>
  <span class="i0">(It pays a connoisseur in crimes</span>
  <span class="i0">To be a perfect saint at times.)</span>
 </div>

 <div class="stanza">
  <span class="i0">Of course there always lies the chance</span>
  <span class="i2">That he is charged with being ill,</span>
  <span class="i0">And all his innocent romance</span>
  <span class="i2">Is ruined by a rhubarb pill.</span>
  <span class="i0">(Alas! 'Tis not alone the Good</span>
  <span class="i0">That are so much misunderstood.)</span>
 </div>

 <div class="stanza">
  <span class="i0">But, as a rule, when he behaves</span>
  <span class="i2">(Evincing no malarial signs),</span>
  <span class="i0">His friends are all his faithful slaves,</span>
  <span class="i2">Until he once again declines</span>
  <span class="i0">With easy conscience, more or less,</span>
  <span class="i0">To undiluted wickedness.</span>
 </div>

 <div class="stanza">
  <span class="i0">The Wicked flourish like the bay,</span>
  <span class="i2">At Cards or Love they always win,</span>
  <span class="i0">Good Fortune dogs their steps all day,</span>
  <span class="i2">They fatten while the Good grow thin.</span>
  <span class="i0">The Righteous Man has much to bear;</span>
  <span class="i0">The Bad becomes a Bullionaire!</span>
 </div>

 <div class="stanza">
  <span class="i0">For, though he be the greatest sham,</span>
  <span class="i2">Luck favours him his whole life through;</span>
  <span class="i0">At "Bridge" he always makes a Slam</span>
  <span class="i2">After declaring "Sans atout";</span>
  <span class="i0">With ev'ry deal his fate has planned</span>
  <span class="i0">A hundred Aces in his hand.</span>
 </div>

 <div class="stanza">
  <span class="i0">And it is always just the same;</span>
  <span class="i2">He somehow manages to win,</span>
  <span class="i0">By mere good fortune, any game</span>
  <span class="i2">That he may be competing in.</span>
  <span class="i0">At Golf no bunker breaks his club,</span>
  <span class="i0">For him the green provides no "rub."</span>
 </div>

 <div class="stanza">
  <span class="i0">At Billiards, too, he flukes away</span>
  <span class="i2">(With quite unnecessary "side");</span>
  <span class="i0">No matter what he tries to play,</span>
  <span class="i2">For him the pockets open wide;</span>
  <span class="i0">He never finds both balls in baulk,</span>
  <span class="i0">Or makes miss-cues for want of chalk.</span>
 </div>

 <div class="stanza">
  <span class="i0">He swears; he very likely bets;</span>
  <span class="i2">He even wears a flaming necktie;</span>
  <span class="i0">Inhales Egyptian cigarettes</span>
  <span class="i2">And has a "Mens Inconscia Recti";</span>
  <span class="i0">Yet, spite of all, one must confess</span>
  <span class="i0">That naught succeeds like his excess.</span>
 </div>

 <div class="stanza">
  <span class="i0">There's no occasion to be Just,</span>
  <span class="i2">No need for motives that are fine,</span>
  <span class="i0">To be Director of a Trust,</span>
  <span class="i2">Or Manager of a Combine;</span>
  <span class="i0">Your corner is a public curse,</span>
  <span class="i0">Perhaps; but it will fill your purse.</span>
 </div>

 <div class="stanza">
  <span class="i0">Then stride across the Public's bones,</span>
  <span class="i2">Crush all opponents under you,</span>
  <span class="i0">Until you "rise on stepping-stones</span>
  <span class="i2">Of their dead selves"; and, when you do,</span>
  <span class="i0">The widow's and the orphan's tears</span>
  <span class="i0">Shall comfort your declining years!</span>
 </div>

 <div class="stanza">
  <span class="i0">But having had your boom in oil,</span>
  <span class="i2">And made your millions out of it,</span>
  <span class="i0">Would you propose to cease from toil?</span>
  <span class="i2">Great Vanderfeller! Not a bit!</span>
  <span class="i0">You've <i>got</i> to labour, day and night,</span>
  <span class="i0">Until you die&mdash;and serve you right!</span>
 </div>

 <div class="stanza">
  <span class="i0">Then, when you stop this frenzied race,</span>
  <span class="i2">And others in your office sit,</span>
  <span class="i0">You'll leave the world a better place,</span>
  <span class="i2">&mdash;The better for your leaving it!</span>
  <span class="i0">For there's a chance perhaps your heir</span>
  <span class="i0">May spend what you've collected there.</span>
 </div>

 <div class="stanza">
  <span class="i0">Myself, how lucky I must be,</span>

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.org/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the

Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.org),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon

form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works

access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
